abstract = {We consider the cybersecurity challenges arising from communications between autonomous vehicles and smart infrastructures. In particular, we consider coordination between vehicles and Reduced Speed Work Zones (RSWZ). Malicious or tampered communications between these entities can have catastrophic consequences. We discuss methods for the analysis of such attacks. In particular, we show how to generate configurable, effective vehicular trajectories for exploring such attacks and how to utilize such trajectories in identifying impactful attacks and evaluating defenses.},
